# PrinterControls
 I need a way to virtually control my 3D printer at home.


### How does this work?
I have a google drive folder where I store files that I want printed. If I want to print it I will upload the print file to the folder. Then I use the discord bot to print stuff. 
What I want it to be able to do is send commands to get a picture of the printer bed, a command to get the print status, a command to start and stop the print, and a command to get and print a particular file. I also want to be able to send a command to get a list of all the files in the folder.

I use my favorite remote interfacing tool: Discord

Commands:
 - `!pic` - Get a picture of the printer bed
 - `!status` - Get the status of the printer
 - `!pause` - Pause the current print
 - `!resume` - Resume the current print
 - `!cancel` - Cancel the current print
 - `!print <filename>` - Print the file with the given filename
 - `!list` - Get a list of all the files in the folder
 - `!help` - Get a list of all the commands
 - `!ping` - Get a response from the bot
